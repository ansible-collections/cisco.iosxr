bugfixes:
  - iosxr_user - replaced custom paramiko sftp and ssh usage with native "copy_file" and "send_command" functions. Fixed issue when ssh key copying doesn't work with network_cli or netconf plugin by deleting "provider" usage. Fixed improper handling of "No such configuration item" when getting data for username section, without that ansible always tried to delete user "No" when purging if there is no any user in config. Fixed one-line admin mode commands not work anymore for ssh key management on IOS XR Software, Version 7.1.3, and add support of "admin" module property (https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.iosxr/pull/15)
